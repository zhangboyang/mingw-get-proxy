mingw-get can't download files from sourceforge on winxp
because sourceforge blocks user-agents of IE6-8 on winxp

this tiny program is a http proxy server, usage:
1. modify this script if necessary
2. run this script using python 3 on a unix system
3. set http proxy setting in 'Internet Settings' in 'Control Panel' on winxp
4. run mingw-get on winxp, it should be able to download files now
